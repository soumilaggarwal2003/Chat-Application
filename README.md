**Realtime Chat Application (MERN Stack)**

This project is a real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack along with Socket.IO for enabling real-time communication between users.

**Features**

**1. Real-Time Chatting Experience:** Utilizing Socket.IO, this application provides users with a seamless real-time chatting experience, allowing them to exchange messages instantly.

**2. MERN Stack:** The application is built using MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for the backend server, React.js for the frontend user interface, and Node.js for server-side scripting.

**3. User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and authenticate themselves securely to access the chat features.

**Technologies Used**

1. MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing chat messages and user data.
2. Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend server.
3. React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
4. Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
5. Socket.IO: JavaScript library for real-time web applications, enabling bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
