# Real-Time Chat Application (MERN Stack)

This project is a real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack along with Socket.IO for enabling real-time communication between users.

# Features
**1) Real-Time Chatting Experience:** Utilizing Socket.IO, this application provides users with a seamless real-time chatting experience, allowing them to exchange messages instantly.

**2) MERN Stack:** The application is built using MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for the backend server, React.js for the frontend user interface, and Node.js for server-side scripting.

**3) User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and authenticate themselves securely to access the chat features.

# Technologies Used

**MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing chat messages and user data.

**Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend server.

**React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

**Socket.IO:** JavaScript library for real-time web applications, enabling bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
